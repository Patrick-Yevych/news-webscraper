Seperate scrapers.html into two pages, one which can edit scrapers (for admins only) and another which can't (for normal users). Alternatively, show the regular scrapers.html for everyone, but if you are not logged in as admin, prompt for login when clicking any scraper management related button. Or, pop-up that those options are disabled for purposes of demonstration.
